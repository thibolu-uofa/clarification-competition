"""Curiosity by Design - frozen baseline (BasicCuriosity).

FROZEN. This is the exact algorithm that scored TDS 0.6161 / Pass@1 64.16% / nDCG 0.8675 on
the 770-example validation split on 2026-10-05, 2nd of six on the public leaderboard. It is
kept loadable so later versions can be A/B'd against it without a checkout; the same bytes
are tagged `baseline-val-0.6161`.

It is the fallback submission. To fall back, copy this file over `curiosity_by_design.py` and
restore the class name to `CuriosityByDesign`, so the reported numbers describe the submitted
file. Do not change anything here: the moment it differs behaviourally, those numbers stop
describing it.


Finds what a task leaves open by differential testing. Several candidate
programs are sampled for the same task and executed on generated inputs. An
input on which the candidates disagree points at an underspecified requirement
and is turned into one clarifying question about the behaviour behind it. The
final implementation is generated from the problem and the user's answer.

# STATUS: basic implementation of steps 1-7. Every step runs end to end; the TODOs mark the
# refinements from the plan that are not implemented yet (coverage-guided input generation,
# input shrinking, branch traces, mutation testing, structured logging).
#
# Degradation: `env.exec_code` needs Docker. When it is unavailable or the sandbox returns
# nothing usable, `run` falls back to asking the model directly for the most critical
# question (step 6b), so the algorithm still produces a result without Docker.
